In the heart of the kingdom of Adanac, a troubling phenomenon has emerged—the gradual decline of the beloved elpam trees. These trees not only serve as a source of beauty but also play a crucial role in providing sustenance and fostering trade within the kingdom. However, the tranquility of Adanac’s forests has been disrupted by the insidious presence of snacirema insects, small yet formidable pests originating from the southern regions. These insects inflict significant damage on the elpam trees, particularly during the harsh winter months, threatening the stability of Adanac’s food supply and economic prosperity.

Over the past decade, the scientific community has been diligently monitoring the health of elpam trees and the prevalence of snacirema infestation across 200 territories within Adanac. Through meticulous observation and data collection, researchers have endeavored to unravel the mysteries surrounding the decline of the elpam trees and the role played by the invasive snacirema insects. By systematically assessing snacirema populations on selected trees each fall and documenting tree survival rates in the subsequent spring, a wealth of information has been amassed.

This report aims to delve into the intricacies of the data collected over the past decade, with a particular focus on addressing two fundamental questions:

- Has there been an increase in the population of snacirema insects over the past 10 years?
- Is there a correlation between the abundance of snacirema insects and the mortality rate of elpam trees?
- 
Furthermore, it is hypothesized that older elpam trees may exhibit heightened vulnerability to snacirema infestation, warranting additional investigation into the age-related dynamics of tree survival.

To shed light on these inquiries, the report will explore the application of statistical methodologies, including logistic regression and Poisson regression, to discern patterns and relationships within the data. By discerning meaningful insights from our comprehensive dataset, we endeavor to uncover actionable intelligence that may aid in mitigating the threat posed by snacirema infestation and safeguarding the future of Adanac’s elpam trees.
